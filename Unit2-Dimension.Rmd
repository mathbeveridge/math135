## Activities

### Find the Dimension

Find the dimension of the following quantities.

1. Momentum is the product of mass and velocity.
1. Jerk is the rate at which acceleration changes with respect to time.
1. Voltage is the work needed per unit charge to move a test charge between two points.



### Dimensionally Feasible

A formula is **dimensionally feasible** when the units for the two sides match.
Decide whether each of the following formulas is dimensionally feasible or infeasible.

1. $s = vt + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ where $s$ is displacement, $v$ is velocity and $a$ is acceleration.
1. $P = E/A$ where $P$ is pressure, $E$ is energy and $A$ is area.


### Geometric Formulas for a Cylinder

A student is trying to remember the formulas for the surface area $A$ and the volume $V$ of a cylander of radius $r$ and height $h$. They come across the following two formulas:
$$ \pi r^2 h$$
and
$$ 2\pi r (r+h).$$
What are the dimensions for each of these formulas? Why does this tell you which one is $A$ and which one is $V$?

### Unit Conversions

Solve the following problems by multiplying by the appropriate unit conversions.
This [unit conversion chart](https://www.mustangps.org/Downloads/conversion_chart.pdf)  will be helpful, or you can use Google to find a particular conversion, for example just search for "km to miles".
<!-- This [online unit converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/) or [Google's unit converter](https://www.google.com/search?q=unit+conversion) will help you to solve these problems -->

1. Convert a density of 3 g/mL into pounds/in$^3$.

1. A car is going 35 miles per hour. How many feet per second is it traveling? 

1. Sunight deposits energy at a rate of $250 W/m^2$ on a $10 m^2$ garden. How much energy (in Joules) is desposited in a week? Note that 1 Watt is 1 Joule per second)
