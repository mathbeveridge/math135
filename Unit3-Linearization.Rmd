The linearization of $f(x)$ at $x=a$ is
$$
L_a(x) = f(a) + f'(a) (x-a).
$$

<!--
The linearization of $f(x,y)$ at point $(a,b)$ is
$$
L_{(a,b)(x,y) = f(a,b) + f_x(a,b) (x-a) + f_y(a,b) (x-b).

## Estimating Sugar Solution Temperature

 
We are boiling a sugar solution to make salt water taffy. When we start, the temperature of the solution is $80^\circ$F, after 5 minutes it's $115^\circ$F, and after 10 minutes it's $165^\circ$F. 

1. Estimate the temperature after 17 minutes.
1. The sugar solution needs to reach $289^\circ$F to be the consistancy of taffy. Estimate when this will happen.

## Comparing Linearizations

1. Draw two (nonlinear) functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and their linearizations at $x=1$. One function should be "well estimated" by the linearization around $x=1$ and the other should be "poorly estimated" by the linearization around $x=1$. 
2. What feature(s) of the curve $y=f(x)$ result in a good approximation?
2. What feature(s) of the curve $y=g(x)$ result in a bad approximation?

## Estimating a Function

1. Find the linearization $L_2(x)$ the function $g(t)=t^3+e^t-4$.    
   * Remember that $L_2(x)$ means "the local linear approximation at $x=2$."  
   * You will need to use desmos to approximate $f'(2)$.

2. Use your formula for $L_2(x)$ to estimate $g(2.1)$, $g(1.98)$, $g(3)$ and $g(0.7)$. 

3. Check your estimations with the original function.
  
4. What do you notice about your approximations as you get further from the spot where you built the linearization?



## Estimating the Windchill

We've  talked about windchill $w(t,v)$ as a function of temperature $t$ and wind speed $v$. Here is the table that we've used

![](images/wind-chill.png){width=100%}

1. The perceived temperature when $t=-10 ^\circ$F and $v=40$ mph is $w(-10,40)=-43$. I have used desmos to estimate that
$$
w_t(-10,-40) = 1.39, \qquad w_v(-10,40)= âˆ’0.28.
$$
Use these values to find the linearization $L_{(-10,40)}(t,v)$ at the point $(-10,40)$.

2. Use your linearization (and desmos!) to estimate the four windchill values $w(-5,40)$, $w(-15,40)$, $(10,45)$ and $(10,35)$. Are your estimates close to the actual values? 


3. Find the linearization of $w(t,v)$ at $t=30$ and $v=10$. 
   a. Estimate the partial derivatives using the table above.
   b. Estimate the partial derivatives using desmos and the formula $w(t,v) = 35.74+0.6215 t-35.75 v^{0.16}+0.4275 t \, v^{0.16}$. Here is a [link to my desmos calculator for the partial derivatives of this function. ](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dvuhpknthj)
