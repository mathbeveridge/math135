## Activities


### Growing Bacteria

A bacteria population is growing at a rate given by 
$$f(t)=3+0.1t^2 \quad \text{  millions of bacteria per hour}$$

A plot of this growth rate is shown below.

We have already estimated the change in population from $t=0$ to $t=4$ using intervals of width 1. Find a better estimate of the increase in population by

1. Using intervals of width 1/2 and evaluating $f(t)$ at the **right endpoint** of each interval. 
1. Using intervals of width 1/2 and evaluating $f(t)$ at the **left endpoint** of each interval.

You can do this by hand, or use Desmos to help out. Decide whether your value is an over-estimate or an under-estimate.


## The Change in World Population

The rate of change of the world's population, in millions of people per year, is in the table below. 


Year  | 1950 | 1960 | 1970 | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 
------+------+------+------+------+------+------
Rate of Change | 37   | 41  | 78  | 77  | 86  | 79   

Using this information, estimate the **total change** in the world's population between 1950 and 2000 by using

1. A left endpoint estimate
2. A right endpoint estimate

### Speed Tests

The velocity of a new electric car is measured every two seconds. The data is shown below.

Time (seconds) | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8   
---------------+---+---+---+---+---
Velocity (m/s) | 0 | 8 | 16.7 | 27.3 | 36.2 


Estimate the total distance traveled by this car in the first eight seconds by using

1. A left endpoint estimate
2. A right endpoint estimate
