## Activities

### Growing population

A population starts with $50,000$ organisms and grows by $6.7\%$ each year. Find an exponential model for the population.

### Consumer price index
The consumer price index (CPI) for a given year is the amount of money in that year that has the same purchasing power as \$100 in 1983. At the start of 2009, the CPI was 211. Write a formula for the CPI as a function of $t$ years after 2009, assuming the CPI increases by a rate of 2.8\% every year. 





### Two data sets
Here are approximate values of two functions, $f$ and $g$.  For each function, if you think it could be linear or exponential, give a reason and find an approximate formula.

|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|   $x$  | 20 | 20.5 | 21 | 21.5 | 22 | 22.5 | 23 |
| $f(x)$ | 26.00 | 26.15 | 26.30 | 26.45 | 26.60 | 26.75 | 26.90 |
| $g(x)$ | 190 | 217 | 247 | 282 | 321 | 366  | 418


<!--
\begin{solution}
First, we note that the $x$ values are equally spaced. For $f(x)$, the value increases by $0.15$ for each entry, suggesting a linear function. The slope is
\begin{equation}
y = \frac{26.15-26}{20.5-20}=0.3.
\end{equation}
To find the $f$-intercept, we can plug any data point into $f=0.3x+b$, from which we find $b=20$. Therefore, $f=0.3x+20$.
For $g(x)$, we note that each successive value is the previous one multiplied by approximately $1.14$. Since the points are spaced by 0.5, then $1.14^2=1.3$ suggesting the exponential function $g(x) = 190 \cdot (1.3)^{(x-20)}$, or equivalently, $g(x) = 0.9997 \cdot 1.3^x$.
\end{solution}

### Interest rate for an investment
If an investment triples in 15 years, what interest rate (compounded continuously) does the investment earn?
<!-- \begin{solution}
Let's refer to the initial investment as $P_0$. Since continuous compounding is mentioned, we assume that we should use an exponential model of the form $P(t) = P_0 \exp{kt}$. The continuous compounding rate is $k$. Since the investment triples in 15 years, we know that
\begin{eqnarray*}
3 P_0 & = & P_0 e^{15k}\\
3 & = & e^{15k} \\
\ln 3 & = & 15 k \\
k & = & (\ln 3)/15 \approx 0.073.
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, the interest rate is about 7.3\%.
\end{solution} -->

### Exponential decay
Radioactive cobalt-60 has a half-life of 5.3 years. If the initial amount is 60 grams, find a formula for the amount of cobalt-60 left after $t$ years. 
<!-- \begin{solution}
Our function is $f(t) = P_0 a^t$ where $t$ is time in years, and $f(t)$ is the amount of colbalt-60 in grams. Since $60 = f(0) = P_0 a^0$, we know that $P_0 = 60$. Hence, $f(t) = 60 a^t$. Since The half life is 5.3 years, we know that
\begin{eqnarray*}
30 & = & 60 a^{5.3}\\
\frac{30}{60} & = & a^{5.3} \\
\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^ {1/5.3} & = & a \\
0.877 & \approx & a.
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, $f(t) = 60(0.877)^t$.
\end{solution} -->

### Doubling time

The doubling time of an exponentially increasing fuunction is the amount of time it takes for the quantity to double. Find the doubling time for the function $f(t) = 10 e^{1.2t}$.

### People and vehicles
In 1980, there were about 170 million vehicles (cars and trucks) and about 227 million people in the United States. The number of vehicles has been  growing at an annual rate of  4\% a year, while the population has been growing at an annual rate of 1\% a year. 

1. When was there, on average, one vehicle per person? 
<!--	\begin{solution}
Let $v(t)$ be the number of vehicles (in millions) t years after 1980 and $p(t)$ be the number of people (in millions) t years after 1980. Based on the given information we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
v(t) & = & 170(1.04)^t\\
p(t) & = & 227(1.01)^t.
\end{eqnarray*}
We want to solve
\begin{eqnarray*}
v(t) & = & p(t) \\
170(1.04)^t & = & 227(1.01)^t \\
\left( \frac{1.04}{1.01} \right)^t & = & \frac{227}{170} \\
(1.0297) ^ t & = & 227/170 \\
t \ln 1.0297 & = & \ln 1.3353 \\
t & \approx & 9.87.
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $t$ is years since 1980, there will be one car per person in the year 1980 + 9.87 = 1989.87, that is, nearly 1990.
\end{solution} -->

2. In RStudio, make a plot of the number of vehicles and the number of people over time on the same graph with a different color for each curve.
<!--
\begin{solution}
\begin{verbatim}
plotFun(170*1.04^t~t,xlim=range(0,40),xlab='Year since 1980',ylab='Number',
main='Comparison of People vs Vehicles')
plotFun(227*1.01^t~t,add=TRUE,col="green")
\end{verbatim}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{PeopleVehiclesPlot.png}
\end{solution} -->

3. Use your models to predict the number of vehicles and the number of people today. Then use Google to see how accurate these models are over time.
<!-- \begin{solution}
\begin{eqnarray*}
v(40) & = & 170(1.04)^{40} \approx 816.17 \text{ million vehicles}\\
p(40) & = & 227(1.01)^{40} \approx 337.97 \text{ million vehicles.}
\end{eqnarray*}
Google says there are about 273.6 million vehicles today and 328.2 million people.
\end{solution} -->
