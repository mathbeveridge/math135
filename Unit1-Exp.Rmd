## Tasks


1. Here are approximate values of two functions, $f$ and $g$.  For each function, if you think it could be linear or exponential, give a reason and find an approximate formula.

|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|   $x$  | 20 | 20.5 | 21 | 21.5 | 22 | 22.5 | 23 |
| $f(x)$ | 26.00 | 26.15 | 26.30 | 26.45 | 26.60 | 26.75 | 26.90 |
| $g(x)$ | 190 | 217 | 247 | 282 | 321 | 366  | 418


<!--
\begin{solution}
First, we note that the $x$ values are equally spaced. For $f(x)$, the value increases by $0.15$ for each entry, suggesting a linear function. The slope is
\begin{equation}
y = \frac{26.15-26}{20.5-20}=0.3.
\end{equation}
To find the $f$-intercept, we can plug any data point into $f=0.3x+b$, from which we find $b=20$. Therefore, $f=0.3x+20$.
For $g(x)$, we note that each successive value is the previous one multiplied by approximately $1.14$. Since the points are spaced by 0.5, then $1.14^2=1.3$ suggesting the exponential function $g(x) = 190 \cdot (1.3)^{(x-20)}$, or equivalently, $g(x) = 0.9997 \cdot 1.3^x$.

2. A September 2007 article included the following passage about Peter Thiel, a Facebook investor and insider.

> Thiel justified his faith (besides his stake in the company) in Facebook's prowess based on the exponential growth of the social network. Facebook is growing at 3 to 4 percent compounded weekly, with about 38 million members currently, he told me. At the current growth rate Facebook would have 220 million members in a year. ``In three years, we could have everybody on the planet, but that's not going to happen, but people underestimate the power of the exponential growth we are seeing," he said.

  a. Construct a generic model function $F(t)$ (that is, with no numeric values in it) for the number of Facebook users at time $t$. Make sure to make a good choice for the units of $t$ and $F(t)$ and be sure to state what they are.
<!-- \begin{solution}
As suggested by the quotation, we choose an exponential growth model $F(t)=P_0 a^t$. Here, $P_0$ represents the initial number of users. Since the information we are given measures users in millions and time in weeks, we choose the units of $F$ to be millions of users, and the units of $t$ to be weeks.
\end{solution}-->
  b. Assuming 3\% weekly growth, predict the number of users in one year from September 2007.
<!--\begin{solution}
We are given that $F(0) = 38$, and hence $P_0 = 38$. If we want 3\% growth per week, $a = 1.03$. Therefore, $F(t) = 38(1.03)^t$. To predict the number of users one year from September 2007, we must find $F(52)$ since there are 52 weeks in a year. Plugging in, we find $F(52) = 176.7$. Thus, we expect 176.7 million users.
\end{solution}-->
  c. Assuming 4\% weekly growth, predict the number of users in one year from September 2007.
<!--\begin{solution}
This is almost identical to the previous part, except that now $a=1.04$. In this case, $F(52) = 38(1.04)^{52}= 292.1$. Thus, we expect 292.1 million users.
\end{solution}-->
  d. Determine the rate of growth that will result in 220 million users in one year from September 2007. Then, use this to update your model from part (a), and make a plot of your function in RStudio.
<!-- \begin{solution}
Our model is $F(t) = 38a^t$. We wish to find the value of $a$ for which $F(52) = 220$. That is,
\begin{eqnarray*}
220  & = & 38 a^{52}\\
\frac{220}{38} & = & a^{52} \\
\left( \frac{220}{38} \right) ^ {1/52} & = & a \\
1.0343 & \approx & a.
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus, 3.43\% growth per week will result in 220 million users one year later.
\end{solution}-->
  
  Note: the actual number of Facebook users in September 2008 was 100 million.

3. Radioactive cobalt-60 has a half-life of 5.3 years. If the initial amount is 60 grams, find a formula for the amount of cobalt-60 left after $t$ years. Plot your function in RStudio.
<!-- \begin{solution}
Our function is $f(t) = P_0 a^t$ where $t$ is time in years, and $f(t)$ is the amount of colbalt-60 in grams. Since $60 = f(0) = P_0 a^0$, we know that $P_0 = 60$. Hence, $f(t) = 60 a^t$. Since The half life is 5.3 years, we know that
\begin{eqnarray*}
30 & = & 60 a^{5.3}\\
\frac{30}{60} & = & a^{5.3} \\
\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^ {1/5.3} & = & a \\
0.877 & \approx & a.
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, $f(t) = 60(0.877)^t$.
\end{solution} -->

4. In 1980, there were about 170 million vehicles (cars and trucks) and about 227 million people in the United States. The number of vehicles has been growing at 4\% a year, while the population has been growing at 1\% a year. 
   a. When was there, on average, one vehicle per person? 
<!--	\begin{solution}
Let $v(t)$ be the number of vehicles (in millions) t years after 1980 and $p(t)$ be the number of people (in millions) t years after 1980. Based on the given information we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
v(t) & = & 170(1.04)^t\\
p(t) & = & 227(1.01)^t.
\end{eqnarray*}
We want to solve
\begin{eqnarray*}
v(t) & = & p(t) \\
170(1.04)^t & = & 227(1.01)^t \\
\left( \frac{1.04}{1.01} \right)^t & = & \frac{227}{170} \\
(1.0297) ^ t & = & 227/170 \\
t \ln 1.0297 & = & \ln 1.3353 \\
t & \approx & 9.87.
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $t$ is years since 1980, there will be one car per person in the year 1980 + 9.87 = 1989.87, that is, nearly 1990.
\end{solution} -->

   b. In RStudio, make a plot of the number of vehicles and the number of people over time on the same graph with a different color for each curve.
<!--
\begin{solution}
\begin{verbatim}
plotFun(170*1.04^t~t,xlim=range(0,40),xlab='Year since 1980',ylab='Number',
main='Comparison of People vs Vehicles')
plotFun(227*1.01^t~t,add=TRUE,col="green")
\end{verbatim}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{PeopleVehiclesPlot.png}
\end{solution} -->

   c. Use your models to predict the number of vehicles and the number of people today. Then use google to see how accurate these models are over time.
<!-- \begin{solution}
\begin{eqnarray*}
v(40) & = & 170(1.04)^{40} \approx 816.17 \text{ million vehicles}\\
p(40) & = & 227(1.01)^{40} \approx 337.97 \text{ million vehicles.}
\end{eqnarray*}
Google says there are about 273.6 million vehicles today and 328.2 million people.
\end{solution} -->

5. If an investment triples in 15 years, what interest rate (compounded continuously) does the investment earn?
<!-- \begin{solution}
Let's refer to the initial investment as $P_0$. Since continuous compounding is mentioned, we assume that we should use an exponential model of the form $P(t) = P_0 \exp{kt}$. The continuous compounding rate is $k$. Since the investment triples in 15 years, we know that
\begin{eqnarray*}
3 P_0 & = & P_0 e^{15k}\\
3 & = & e^{15k} \\
\ln 3 & = & 15 k \\
k & = & (\ln 3)/15 \approx 0.073.
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, the interest rate is about 7.3\%.
\end{solution} -->
