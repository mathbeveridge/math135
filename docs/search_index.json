When \\(k &lt; 0\\), we have exponential decay. This includes radioactive decay, and the metabolization of a drug in the bloodstream. 37.1.2 Exponential Growth/Decay with Constant Input/Output The differential equation \\[\\frac{dP}{dt} = k (P-A)\\] is exponential growth/decay with constant input/output. Its solution is \\[P(t) = A + C e^{k \\, t}.\\] When \\(k &gt;0\\) and \\(H =kA\\), we have the population model \\[ \\frac{dP}{dt} = kP-H \\] for exponential growth at rate \\(k\\) with constant harvesting at rate \\(H\\). 37.1.3 Constrained Growth The differential equation \\[\\frac{dP}{dt} = r \\, P \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right)\\] has the logistic function as its solution \\[P(t) = \\frac{K}{1+ C e^{-r \\, t}}.\\] When \\(r&gt;0\\) and \\(K&gt;0\\), we have constrained growth at rate \\(r\\) with carrying capacity \\(K\\). 37.1.4 Newton’s Law of Cooling Newton’s Law of Cooling states that the rate of change of temperature of an object \\(\\frac{dT}{dt}\\) is related to the ambient temperature \\(A\\) by the equation: \\[ \\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-A).\\] Note that this is the same differential equation as exponential growth with constant harvesting. 37.2 Activities 37.2.1 Drug Metabolization After a drug is administered in a single injection, the rate at which the drug leaves the body is proportional to the quantity present. What differential equation models this process? Suppose that 10 mg of a drug is injected into the bloodstream. 3 hours later, only 2 mg remains in the bloodstream. Find the formula for the amount of the drug \\(Q(t)\\) after \\(t\\) hours. Suppose that a drug is being administered at a constant rate of 60 mg/hour and its decreasing at a rate of 20% of the amount present. What differential equation models this process? Find the formula for the amount of drug \\(Q(t)\\) after \\(t\\) hours. What value does \\(Q(t)\\) converge to for large values of \\(t\\)? 37.2.2 Optimal Coffee Temperature In my \\(22^\\circ C\\) office, my coffee starts at \\(80^\\circ C\\), but cools to \\(75^\\circ C\\) after 10 minutes. If I like my coffee between \\(63^\\circ C\\) and \\(70^\\circ C\\), how long is my window to drink it? 37.2.3 Constrained Rabbit Population The yearly population \\(P(t)\\) of rabbits is modeled by \\[ \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.45 P \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{90} \\right). \\] If the current population is \\(P=120\\), will the population increase or decrease? How do you know? For what values of \\(P\\) is \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}=0\\)? What value does \\(P(t)\\) converge to for large values of \\(t\\)? 37.2.4 Constrained Deer Population The annual population \\(P(t)\\) of deer is modeled by the constrained growth equation \\[ \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.22 P - 0.0275 P^2. \\] What is the growth rate \\(r\\)? What is the carrying capacity \\(K\\)? How large is the deer population when that population is growing at its fastest rate? How fast is the population growing at that time?
