In real world mathematics, you will need to be able to work with data and apply your calculus concepts directly. That’s what we’ll do in RStudio, as it provides an excellent sandbox for us to play in. R (what RStudio is based on) is the programming language used by professional statisticians, so these skills will be useful no matter what field you go into! However, just like any programming language, there is a startup cost. The learning curve for RStudio can be pretty steep, particularly if you’ve never done any coding before. Don’t worry, that’s where this guide comes in! In here you’ll find all sorts of explanation and examples for some of the coding we’ll be doing in (and out of) class. I promise, it’ll be worth in the end, and you’ll be a coding master. 1.1 Getting Oriented 1.1.1 First login You’ll get into RStudio via the url https://rstudio.macalester.edu. It’s linked in our Moodle page if you’re feeling a little lazy. Your login is your Macalester username and password. You’ll be given the following page (with your username in the uppper right corner): I tend to ignore the projects and just activate a new session by clicking that panel. 1.1.2 The RStudio window Once you’ve got an active session, you’ll be shown the following window. We’ll talk about its parts, starting with the four panels you’ll see. This picture is from a previous version of RStudio, but everything should work the same! 1.1.2.1 Panels Source: This is where you will edit RMarkdown notebooks, which are described much more in the RMarkdown section. Console: This is RStudio’s command line. It’s a great place to test code and serves as a basic calculator. Environment, history: this panel keeps track of your work. The environment tab shows all the variables you have named in the session (including data, functions, and lists) and gives you a preview of them. The history tab tracks the pieces of code you run. Everything else: this is where you’ll find a lot of stuff, including the files you build and the plots you create of data/functions. It also has the packages list (described in the next subsection) and the help window, which can show you documentation of commands. Now that we know what we’re looking at, let’s talk specifics. We’ll talk a lot more about the source panel in the RMarkdown section. 1.1.2.2 Specific functions The new document button. This is how you’ll make new files in your source window. The quit session button. Somtimes it’s best to just start over if you can’t figure out why something it not working. You’ll be kicked back to that first page from the previous section. The clean environment button. Use this when you want to clear all you variables, including data sets. The files buttons. You’ll use these to create, delete, and organize RMarkdown files and data files. See the data section for more information on how to upload data. 1.1.2.3 Command Line Console The command line console is the most basic way to run code. It’s great for simple calculations and to test out code before you run it. We’ll run longer blocks of code in our notebooks. You can try out a few calculations here. Notice! Once you run a command (by pressing enter) it is gone to history. You don’t go back and edit previous lines if you find a mistake. Instead, you run the command again with the fixed piece in a new line. Thankfully, RStudio makes this not so terrible. By pushing the UP button on your keyboard, you can scroll through previous commands that you’ve used. 1.1.3 Packages RStudio is open source, which means many people write packages to augment what it can do by default. Their work is our gain, and we’ll need a few packages to be able to access what we want. In the lower right hand panel click on the packages tab. Then click on the check boxes next to the following packages: fetch: this package knows how to load in data files mosaic, mosaicCore, mosaicData: these contain the specific built-ins which create and plot functions for us. By checking the box by them, we import their functions into the session. Easy enough. mosaicCalc: Some of the function commands from the mosaic family of packages don’t interact well with the built in derivative and antiderivative functions in RStudio. mosaicCalc fixes this If you don’t see mosaicCalc, then you need to download it. Run the following line of code in your console: install.packages(\"mosaicCalc\") Once you do this, make sure that the mosaicCal box is checked in the packages list 1.2 RMarkdown In AMC1, we’ll be working with code a lot: writing it, running it, analyzing it, and commenting on it. We’ll also be going back to code we’ve already used and tweaking it to solve new but related questions. For all of these reasons, we’re going to use RMarkdown notebooks. The notebook will run large chunks of code at a time and show the output right next to the code. It’s also easier for you to comment on the code you’ve written and go back to it later. The best way to get working on this is to upload the template that I’ve put in the course Moodle page and just start experimenting with what’s there. I’m sure you’ll get it sorted!

You must assign this to a variable so that you can use it later. So your command must start with f = ... so that you get a function named f. The variable (x or t, etc) that appears in the OUTPUT must match the INPUT variable that appears after the tilde ~. The the command makeFun(x^2 ~ t) won’t work because the x^2 is not a function of t. 2.3 Creating Lists of Data Use c() to “combine” some values into a list. Assign the list to a variable so that you can use it later. my_primes = c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29) my_primes ## [1] 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 my_data = c(5, -2, 7, 3, -10, 15) my_data ## [1] 5 -2 7 3 -10 15 Use seq() to generate a sequential list of values in a specified range. The optional third parameter tells RStudio to increment by that value instead of incrementing by 1. my_seq1 = seq(1,10) my_seq1 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 my_seq2 = seq(5, 6, 0.25) my_seq2 ## [1] 5.00 5.25 5.50 5.75 6.00 my_seq3 = seq(5, 6, 0.1) my_seq3 ## [1] 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 6.0 2.4 Plotting Data Use plotPoints to plot a list of \\(y\\)-axis data versus a list of \\(x\\)-axis data. Separate these lists with a tilde ~. X = seq(1:5) Y = X^2 plotPoints(Y ~ X) x_data = c(2,3,5,8,13) y_data = c(2,4,8,4,2) plotPoints(y_data ~ x_data) 2.5 Plotting Functions Use plotFun to plot a function. As with plotPoints, we use a tilde ~ to separate the output variable (the function) from the input variable. The optional xlim argument specifies the domain for the plot. plotFun(sin(x) ~ x) plotFun(sin(x) ~ x, xlim=c(0, 2*pi)) We can layer one plot on top of another by using the add=TRUE argument. You only need to specify the xlim for the first plot because the second one is added to the first. It’s helpful to change the color for subsequent plots. Use the argument col=\"red\" using any color name you like (RStudio knows a lot of colors!) plotFun(2 * sin(x) ~ x, xlim=c(0, 2*pi)) plotFun(cos(3*x) ~ x, add=TRUE, col=&#39;green&#39;) We can label the axes using xlab and ylab. When you are layering two plots, you must specify these labels in the first function that you plot! plotFun(2 * sin(x) ~ x, xlim=c(0, 2*pi), xlab=&#39;time&#39;, ylab=&#39;displacement&#39;) plotFun(cos(3*x) ~ x, add=TRUE, col=&#39;green&#39;) The plotFun command takes a whole variety of parameters, here are a few useful ones: xlim, ylim: sets the range of your \\(x\\)-axis. Example: xlim=range(1,4), ylim=range(3,60) col: sets the color of the function you plot. RStudio will recognize most basic colors, which you will pass as strings. Example: col=\"red\" add: you’ll use this when you want to add multiple functions to the same plot. We’ll see an example of it below. Example: add=TRUE xlab, ylab: for labeling your axes. You’ll pass this as a string as well. Example: xlab=\"time\", ylab=\"red=velocity, blue=position\" Let’s try some of this out. I broke the third line so it would all fit, you don’t need to! f=makeFun(x^3+3~x) g=makeFun(3*x^2~x) plotFun(f(x)~x, xlim=range(1,4), ylim=range(3,60), col=&quot;blue&quot;,xlab=&quot;time&quot;, ylab=&quot;red=velocity, blue=position&quot;) plotFun(g(x)~x, col=&quot;red&quot;, add=TRUE) RStudio is a little weird about plots in the RMarkdown in that you might get multiples if you’re adding plots together. If you want the chunk to hold all plots until the end, add fig.show='hold' into the script braces at the top of the chunk. 2.6 Plotting Data and Functions We can also combine plots of data and functions using add=TRUE. time_data = seq(0,50, 10) pop_data = c(6.82, 9.63, 14.3, 20.48, 28.94, 42.25) plotPoints(pop_data ~ time_data, xlab=&#39;years since 1950&#39;, ylab=&#39;population (millions)&#39;) P = makeFun( 6.82 * (1.037)^t ~ t) plotFun(P(t) ~ t, add=TRUE, col=&#39;orange&#39;) 2.7 Fitting a Function to Data The fitModel command is part of the mosaic package. Here is how you would fit a linear model to data xdata = c(1,2,3,4,5) ydata = c(5.3, 7.7, 10.1, 11.3, 12.0 ) fitModel(ydata ~ A* xdata + B) ## function (xdata, ..., transformation = function (x) ## x) ## return(transformation(predict(model, newdata = data.frame(xdata = xdata), ## ...))) ## &lt;environment: 0x7fb4f9bd3470&gt; ## attr(,&quot;coefficients&quot;) ## A B ## 1.70 4.18 ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;nlsfunction&quot; &quot;function&quot; This output says that the best fitting linear function has slope \\(A=1.70\\) and \\(y\\)-intercept \\(B=4.18\\). So let’s create the corresponding linear function and plot it with the data. f = makeFun(1.70 * x + 4.18 ~ x) plotPoints(ydata ~ xdata) plotFun(f(x) ~ x, add=TRUE, col=&#39;orange&#39;) 2.7.1 Fitting a Power Function to Data Here are the steps to fit xdata and ydata to a power function \\(f(x) = c x^p\\). Take the log of both xdata and ydata Fit a linear function \\(y = A x + B\\) to the resulting data The original constants are p = A and c = exp(B) Here is an example f = makeFun(4.3 * x^(1.7)~x) xdata = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9) ydata = c(7, 33, 65, 110, 180) logxdata = log(xdata) logydata = log(ydata) fitModel(logydata ~ A * logxdata + B) ## function (logxdata, ..., transformation = function (x) ## x) ## return(transformation(predict(model, newdata = data.frame(logxdata = logxdata), ## ...))) ## &lt;environment: 0x7fb4a98fee70&gt; ## attr(,&quot;coefficients&quot;) ## A B ## 1.449432 1.915983 ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;nlsfunction&quot; &quot;function&quot; This tells us that \\(A=1.45\\) and \\(B=1.92\\). We solve for \\(c\\) and plot the function with the data p = 1.45 p ## [1] 1.45 c = exp(1.92) c ## [1] 6.820958 plotPoints(ydata ~ xdata) plotFun(6.82 * x^1.45 ~ x, add=TRUE, col=&#39;orange&#39;) 2.7.2 Fitting a Model by Specifying Starting Values Sometimes fitModel fails to find a good model for the data. Here are two things that can happen. The command fitModel fails, 7.complaining about a “singular gradient.” This means that fitModel picked a bad starting point, and can’t figure out how to improve it’s initial guess. The command fitModel does find a function, but when we plot it, we realize that it’s not what we want. Here is an example of fitModel returning a function that we don’t like. Let’s load in the `utilities.csv’ data set and look at the first few rows. utilitydata = fetch::fetchData(&quot;utilities.csv&quot;) ## Retrieving from http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/datasets/utilities.csv head(utilitydata) ## month day year temp kwh ccf thermsPerDay dur totalbill ## 1 2 24 2005 29 557 166 6.0 28 213.71 ## 2 3 29 2005 31 772 179 5.5 33 239.85 ## 3 1 27 2005 15 891 224 7.5 30 294.96 ## 4 11 23 2004 43 860 82 2.8 29 160.26 ## 5 12 28 2004 23 1160 208 6.0 35 317.47 ## 6 9 26 2004 71 922 15 0.5 32 117.46 ## gasbill elecbill notes ## 1 166.63 47.08 ## 2 117.05 62.80 ## 3 223.92 71.04 ## 4 88.51 71.75 ## 5 224.18 93.29 ## 6 21.25 96.21 Now let’s plot temperature versus month plotPoints(temp ~ month, data=utilitydata) We have ploted monthly temperature data for multiple years. Let’s try to fit a periodic function. M = fitModel(temp ~ A * sin(w*(month + p))+C, data=utilitydata) coef(M) ## A w p C ## -28.67993 -6.78753 56.15894 47.20908 f = makeFun(-28.7 * sin(-6.8*(t + 56.2))+47.2 ~ t) plotFun(f(t)~t, add=TRUE, col=&#39;red&#39;) This is not what we wanted! It looks like fitModel was confused by the multiple data points for each month. So the frequency w is completely wrong. We can correct this by specifying an initial guess for w. We think that the period should be 12 months, so we want to start with w=2*pi/12. M = fitModel(temp ~ A * sin(w*(month + p))+C, data=utilitydata, start=list(w=2*pi/12)) coef(M) ## w A p C ## 0.5043435 -28.6799747 -22.8387987 47.2090049 f = makeFun(-28.7 * sin(0.5*(t -22.8))+47.2 ~ t) plotFun(f(t)~t, add=TRUE, col=&#39;orange&#39;) That looks much better! 2.8 Plotting Surfaces in 3D We plot functions \\(z = f(x,y)\\) using the plotFun() command. We specify the independent variables with the syntax ~ x&amp;y. By default, RStudio will create a contour plot of this function and include shading to help visualize the values of the function. f = makeFun(x^2 - y^2 ~ x&amp;y) plotFun(f(x,y) ~ x&amp;y) You can add more contours using the levels parameter, and turn off the shading with the filled parameter. plotFun(f(x,y) ~ x&amp;y, levels = seq(-1 ,1, .2), filled = FALSE) You can change the plot range using xlim and ylim. plotFun(f(x,y) ~ x&amp;y, xlim=c(-20,20), ylim=c(-20,20)) You can create a 3D plot by setting surface=TRUE. plotFun(f(x,y) ~ x&amp;y, xlim=c(-20,20), ylim=c(-20,20), surface=TRUE) 2.9 Estimating the Derivative We can estimate the derivative of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) by using the average rate of change \\[ f&#39;(x) \\approx\\frac{f(x+\\alpha)-f(x)}{\\alpha} \\] for some small number \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\). Smaller and smaller \\(\\alpha\\)’s lead to better and better approximations. So we can estimate the derivative by using smaller and smaller \\(\\alpha\\) values until our estimates stabilize. Here is an example that estimates \\(f&#39;(4)\\) for the function \\(f(x) = x^2 + 10*\\sin(x)\\). f=makeFun(x^2+10*sin(x)~x) alpha=c(1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001, 0.0000001) d=(f(4+alpha)-f(4))/alpha d ## [1] 6.978782 1.952538 1.511513 1.468349 1.464042 1.463612 ## [7] 1.463569 1.463564 The estimates stabilize to the value \\(1.46356\\). So our estimate is \\(f&#39;(4) \\approx 1.46456\\) We can use the same method to estimate the partial derivates of \\(g(x,y)\\). We have \\[ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\approx\\frac{g(x+\\alpha,y)-f(x,y)}{\\alpha} \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\approx\\frac{g(x,y+\\alpha)-f(x,y)}{\\alpha} \\] Let’s estimate the partial derivatives of \\(g(x,y) = e^{x \\sin(y)}\\) at the point \\((2, 7)\\). First, let’s estimate \\(g_x(2,7) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\right|_{(2,7)}\\). The code is very similar to the code we used for a single variable function. g=makeFun(exp(x*sin(y))~x&amp;y) alpha=c(1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001, 0.0000001) d=(g(2+alpha,7)-g(2,7))/alpha d ## [1] 3.456634 2.526691 2.452648 2.445403 2.444680 2.444608 ## [7] 2.444601 2.444600 We conclude that \\(g_x(2,7) \\approx 2.445.\\) Now let’s estimate \\(g_y(2,7) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\right|_{(2,7)}\\). All we need to do is move alpha into the \\(y\\)-variable. g=makeFun(exp(x*sin(y))~x&amp;y) alpha=c(1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001, 0.0000001) d=(g(2,7+alpha)-g(2,7))/alpha d ## [1] 3.512524 5.761618 5.628032 5.612215 5.610611 5.610450 ## [7] 5.610434 5.610433 We conclude that \\(g_y(2,7) \\approx 5.610.\\) 2.10 Gradient Search Here is code that will use gradient search to find the maximum of the function \\[ f(x,y) = - x^4 - x^3 + 10 x y + 2y - 8 y^2 \\] whose partial derivatives are \\[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -4 x^3 -3 x^2 + 10 y \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 10 x + 2 - 16 y \\] First, you define the partial derivatives and then choose your starting point (newx, newy). In this case, we start at (1,1). partialx=makeFun( -4*x^3 -3*x^2 + 10*y~x&amp;y) partialy=makeFun(10*x + 2 - 16*y~x&amp;y) newx = 1 newy = 1 Next, you repeatedly run the following code block, which updates the current point by moving 0.1 times the gradient vector. This is equivilant to taking a small step in the uphill direction. Repeatedly to run this code block until the partial derivatives are essentially zero (at least two zeros after the decimal point). Congrats! You have found your local maximum. newx=newx+0.1*partialx(newx,newy) newy=newy+0.1*partialy(newx,newy) # print new partial derivatives c(partialx(newx,newy), partialy(newx,newy)) ## [1] -4.858 0.600 # print new point c(newx, newy) ## [1] 1.3 0.9 Repeatedly running this code block will take you to the point (1.04,0.77). But note that starting at another initial point might take you to a different local maximum. If you want to find a local minimum, then you should multiply the partials by -0.1 instead. This is equivalent to taking a small step downhill. Try this on the function \\(f(x,y) = x^2 + 2 x y + 3 x + 4 y + 5 y^2\\). 2.11 Constrained Optimization Suppose that we want to find the maximum of the production function \\(P(x,y)=3000x^{0.2}y^{0.8}\\) given the constraint \\(Q(x,y)= 4x + 3y = 200\\). We want to make a contour plot of \\(P(x,y)\\) and then add the constraint. The maximum value is achieved where the constraint \\(Q(x,y)=300\\) is tangent to the contour curve of \\(P(x,y)\\). P = makeFun( x^(0.2) * y^(0.8) ~ x&amp;y) Q = makeFun( 4*x + 3*y ~ x&amp;y) plotFun(P(x,y)~x&amp;y, xlim=c(0,80), ylim=c(0,80), filled=FALSE, levels=seq(20,80,5)) plotFun(Q(x,y)~x&amp;y, add=TRUE, filled=FALSE, levels=200) In this case, the optimal value of \\(38\\) is achieved at approximately \\((10, 55)\\). Let’s make another plot to get a better estimate. plotFun(P(x,y)~x&amp;y, xlim=c(0,40), ylim=c(20,60), filled=FALSE, levels=seq(20,50,2)) plotFun(Q(x,y)~x&amp;y, add=TRUE, filled=FALSE, levels=200) On this zoomed in plot, we can refine our estimate a bit. The maximum \\(f(10,53)=38\\) is achieved at \\(x=10\\) and \\(y=53\\). Now, if I want to estimate the Lagrange multiplier \\(\\lambda\\), I would change my constraint a little bit (say to \\(210\\)) and then look at the change in the optimal value. plotFun(P(x,y)~x&amp;y, xlim=c(0,40), ylim=c(20,60), filled=FALSE, levels=seq(20,50,2)) plotFun(Q(x,y)~x&amp;y, add=TRUE, filled=FALSE, levels=c(200,210)) We have \\[ \\lambda = \\frac{\\triangle \\mbox{optimal value}}{\\triangle \\mbox{constraint}} = \\frac{40 - 38}{210-200} = \\frac{2}{10} = 0.2. \\] 2.12 Estimating the Definite Integral The define integral \\(\\int_{a}^b f(x) dx\\) is the (signed) area between the curve \\(y=f(x)\\) and the \\(x\\)-axis. We approximate this area by partitioning the interval \\([a,b]\\) into smaller intervals of width \\(\\triangle x\\) and then summing the areas \\(f(x) \\triangle x\\) of the corresponding rectangles. Here is code that makes this approximation for the function \\(f(x) = x + \\sin(x^2)\\) over the interval \\([5,10]\\). The code splits this interval into 100 subintervals. You can get a better approximation by increasing the denominator of base=(b-a)/100 to a much larger number, for example: base=(b-a)/1000000. f=makeFun(x + sin(x^2)~x) a=5 b=10 base=(b-a)/100 points=seq(from=a+base, to=b, by=base) heights=f(points) areas=base*heights sum(areas) ## [1] 37.67298 2.13 Troubleshooting Without fail, you will run into problems. Sometimes RStudio will give you helpful error messages, but sometimes they are obtuse. Here’s a list of some common errors and what might be wrong: Nothing ran, all I got was a plus sign… You probably forgot some parentheses. Try the following: Enter a parenthesis on that line to see if this closes it out. Press the Escape key to get to a new line. Unexpected symbol in… You may have forgotten a multiplication sign or otherwise gave RStudio a symbol it cannot parse. Check your line of code again to see if you have all your symbols. Object not found… You may not have defined that variable (or function) yet. Check your environment tab to see if it has the object you’re looking for (or if you’ve called it something different than you remember!). You also may be trying to use something from a data set that you have not included as a parameter. See if you need to add in the parameter data=....

RStudio is a front end (user friendly) interface for R, a programming language for statistics. We’ll be using it to work with data and our various forms of functions. RStudio is a long term learning goal for us. We will be adding new functions and learning new things throughout the semester. 3.1 Getting Started Follow my lead as we get ourselves going with RStudio. We will Log in to RStudio Add some packages to the R environment Create a math135 directory to work in Create our first Rmd (‘R Markdown’) file Knit that Rmd file to create a PDF You will need to replace the auto-generated code block at the top of your Rmd file with this one, which loads the mosaic functionality into the R environment when we knit to PDF. ```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mosaic)) ``` Pro Tip: Be kind to future you. Save all of your work for this class in the math135 subdirectory that we create today. Give your files meaningful names. Include the unit, the topic, the date, etc, or a helpful combination of these identifiers. 3.2 R Markdown files An R Markdown file is a hybrid file that has both text and code. You can then knit this Rmd file to make a lovely PDF. 3.2.1 Formatting Regular Text The regular text uses Markdown, which has simple commands to create formatting such has sections, bold, italic, links, itemized lists, and much more. Here are is some example Markdown syntax. # Heading This is a regular sentence. ## Sub Heading You get *italics like this.* Skipping a line starts a new paragraph. But if you don&#39;t skip a line then it&#39;s part of the same paragraph ### Sub Sub Heading You get **bold text like this.** Here is how to make an itemized list * Make sure to skip a line before your first item * The asterisk must be the **first** character on the line (no spaces!) * If you want a sublist + Start the sublist on the line below the item + Indent by three spaces. + Use a plus sign Here is a nice reference page for common R Markdown syntax. 3.2.2 Code Chunks Your R code must be placed inside code chunks. Here is what a code chuck looks like ```{r} 1 + 1 sin(pi/4) ``` When you knit your Rmd file, the code chunks are executed in order. You can also run an individual chunk by clicking on the green arrow in its upper right corner. Adding a code chunk is easy! In the top bar of the Markdown window, there’s a small, green plus C button. When you click this button, it’ll bring up options for code blocks to insert Select “R” which is the first option. (It’s the only one we will use.) 3.3 Writing Code Add a code chunk and let’s get cracking! 3.3.1 Basic Calculations We can use that code chunk to do some basic calculations. 3.3.1.1 You Try Create a code block and try to calculate each of the following. Try some other calculations, too! \\(8+13\\) \\(7*9\\) \\(\\sin(\\pi/2)\\) \\(\\sqrt{121}\\) \\((2.25)^3\\) \\(8 \\cos( \\pi/6)\\) Which ones work? If you got an error, can you fix it? Can you guess the name of the square root function? 3.3.2 Variables, Lists and Sequences When we do a calculation, we can store the result for later. Here are some examples: a = 15 b = 4 * a R is particularly good at doing calculations on lists of data. So let’s make some lists! RStudio makes a list with the c() command. The “c” in short for “combine”. P=c(3, 5, 11, -1, 4) P ## [1] 3 5 11 -1 4 If you want to make a sequence, you use the seq() command. For example: S=seq(1, 10) S ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Notice that the values increment by 1. You can use a different step size by adding a third argument. For exmaple, if I wanted a sequence 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc… all the way up to 2, I would write T=seq(1, 2, 0.1) T ## [1] 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 Now look at the Environment tab in the upper right window. What do you notice? Pro Tips: Be kind to future you as well as current collaborators. Always write 0.1 instead of .1 in your code. It is much easier to read and to debug later! Consider adding a space after your commas to separate parameters. It’s easier to read! 3.3.2.1 You Try Try to do the following: Create a list X containing the values 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9. Create a list Y containing the sequence of odd integers between (and including) 1 and 19 What is the output of the command `X^2’? Can you see what R is doing? Try making another lists. Apply some functions to that list. 3.3.3 Functions Now it’s time to write your own function. Here is how you create \\(f(x)= x^2 -3\\). f = makeFun(x^2 - 3 ~ x) Much of this is pretty intuitive, except for maybe the final ~ x. This tilde symbol comes up a lot in RStudio and it indicates dependence. We need to tell RStudio that \\(f\\) is in terms of this variable \\(x\\), so it knows where to put an input when I ask it to: Notice! In the right upper window, you now have a function called f. We can do a lot with this function, but to start, let’s evaluate it at 1. f(1) ## [1] -2 What do you think this code is doing? f(S) ## [1] -2 1 6 13 22 33 46 61 78 97 3.3.3.1 You Try Create a new function \\(g\\) where \\(g(t) = \\sqrt{t-4}\\) Evaluate this function at \\(t=8\\), and \\(t=12.34\\) and \\(t=100\\) What happens when you try to evaluate this function at \\(t=2\\)? What do you think that means? 3.3.4 Plotting Let’s see how to create plots using RStudio. First, let’s create a plot of this data x 0 1 2 3 4 5 h(x) 0 1 4 9 16 25 from the function \\(h(x)=x^2\\). X = seq(0,5) Y = X^2 plotPoints(Y ~ X) Notice! We list the dependent variable Y first and then the independent variable X after the tidle ~ (which matches the syntax of makeFun). We can also plot a function. Once again the dependent variable appears after the tilde. plotFun(x^2 ~ x) We can actually plot the data and the function on the same graph. We will plot the data and then add the function by using the add=TRUE parameter for plotFun. I will also use the optional col parameter to change the color of the function curve. plotPoints(Y ~ X) plotFun(x^2 ~ x, add=TRUE, col=&#39;red&#39;) 3.3.4.1 You Try Create a sequence of integer points P from 1 to 10. Define Q = sin(P) Create a plot of Q versus P and then add the function plot of sin(x) Try plotting some other data and fuunctions. 3.4 Troubleshooting Without fail, you will make mistakes. Things will break and you’ll get error messages. That’s ok! That’s how we learn. 3.4.1 You Try Each of the following lines of code will break when run. Try them out, notice the error, and see if you can fix it. 2 sin(pi/2) sqrt(3*(7+5) Sqrt(3*(7+5)) makeFun(x^2-4, x) makeFun(x+1 ~ t) makefun(2x+1 ~ x) "],["linear-functions.html", "4 Linear Functions 4.1 Goals 4.2 Activities 4.3 Solutions", " 4 Linear Functions 4.1 Goals Explain linear functions in words, tables, equations, and graphs Describe the effects of varying parameters in linear functions Assess whether given data is linear and, if so, model it with a function 4.2 Activities 4.2.1 Graph of a linear function Find the equation \\(y=mx+b\\) for the graph shown below. 4.2.2 Height and weight of American men The table below lists the average weight, \\(w\\), in pounds of American men in their sixties for height, \\(h\\), in inches.

Find and interpret the rate of change and the vertical intercept. 4.2.4 Oil reserves There were 1650 billion barrels of proven oil reserves in the world as of 2016. At constant consumption levels (and excluding unproven reserves), the world had enough oil to last about 47 more years beyond 2016. Create a linear function \\(R(t)\\) that models the oil reserves (in billions of barrels) where \\(t\\) is the number of years since 2016. Find and interpret the rate of change and the vertical intercept of your function. 4.3 Solutions 4.3.1 Graph of a linear function The slope is \\[ m = \\frac{-5 - 5}{15 - 0} = \\frac{-10}{15}= - \\frac{2}{3}\\] so the formula is \\[ y = - \\frac{2}{3} x + 5\\] 4.3.2 Height and weight of American men Height is the independent variable (input) and weight is the dependent variable (output) Increasing. Yes because we have a constant rate of change. The slope is \\(\\frac{171-166}{69-68}=5\\) so the equation is \\[ w - 166 = 5 (h-68) \\] which is the same as \\[ w = 5h - 174. \\] 4.3.3 Scooter rates The vertical intercept is \\(\\$5.99\\). This is the monthly fee for the service. The rate of change is \\(0.23\\) dollars per minutes. This is the “per minute” usage rate for riding a scooter. Note that there is no “unlocking” fee in this plan. If there was an unlocking fee, then we would need a second input variable: the number of times that the scooter is ridden. 4.3.4 Oil reserves We use all 1650 barrels in 47 years, so the slope is \\(-1650/47=-35.11\\). The formula is \\[ B(t) = - 35.11t+ 1650.\\] The rate of change is 35.11 billions of barrels per year. This is the annual consumption of oil. The vertical intercept os 1650 barrels. This is the amount of oil reserves in 2016.

Compare this to the relative change in the Dow Jones average from 35,443.82 to 35369.09 (from 2 September 2021 to 3 September 2021). 5.3 Solutions 5.3.1 AROC of a function \\[ \\frac{f(3)-f(-1)}{3- (-1)} = \\frac{10-6}{3+1} = \\frac{4}{4}=1 \\] 5.3.2 Measuring daily rainfall The rate of change is \\[\\frac{1.60 - 0.15}{9} = \\frac{1.45}{9} = 0.16\\] The units are inches per hour. 5.3.3 Sketching a function Here are three very different functions that all have an average rate of change of 1 on the interval \\([0,2]\\).

If the initial amount is 60 grams, find a formula for the amount of cobalt-60 left after \\(t\\) years. 6.2.6 Doubling time The doubling time of an exponentially increasing fuunction is the amount of time it takes for the quantity to double. Find the doubling time for the function \\(f(t) = 10 e^{1.2t}\\). 6.2.7 People and vehicles In 1980, there were about 170 million vehicles (cars and trucks) and about 227 million people in the United States. The number of vehicles has been growing at an annual rate of 4% a year, while the population has been growing at an annual rate of 1% a year. According to this model, when was there, on average, one vehicle per person? In desmos, make a plot of the number of vehicles and the number of people over time on the same graph with a different color for each curve. Use your models to predict the number of vehicles and the number of people in 2020. Then use Google to see how accurate these models are over time. 6.3 Solutions 6.3.1 Growing population . \\[ P(t) = 50000 (1.067)^t\\] 6.3.2 Consumer price index \\[C(t) = 211 (1.028)^t\\] 6.3.3 Two data sets First, we note that the \\(x\\) values are equally spaced. For \\(f(x)\\), the value increases by \\(0.15\\) for each entry, suggesting a linear function \\(f(x) = mx+b\\). The slope is \\[ m=\\frac{26.15-26}{20.5-20} = \\frac{0.15}{0.2}=0.3. \\] To find the vertical intercept, we plug in \\(x=0\\) to find that \\(26 = 0.3 \\cdot 0 + b\\), so \\(b=26\\). Therefore, \\[ f=0.3x+26. \\] For \\(g(x)\\), we note that each successive value is the previous one multiplied by approximately \\(1.14\\). The points are evenly spaced so we have constant multiplicative change. This is an exponential function \\(g(x) = C a^t.\\) We have \\(g(0) = 190 = C a^0 = C\\), so \\(c=90\\). Next, let’s plug in any other point. We have \\(g(0.5)=217= 190 a^(0.5) = 190 \\sqrt{a}\\) which means that \\(a = (217/190)^2=1.304\\) So \\[ g(x) = 190 (1.304)^t.\\] 6.3.4 Interest rate for an investment Our initial investment is \\(I_0\\) and we have \\(I(15) = 3 I_0\\). For annual compounding, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} 3 I_0 &amp;=&amp; I_0 (1+r)^{15} \\\\ 3 &amp;=&amp; (1+r)^{15} \\\\ 3^{1/15} &amp;=&amp; 1+r \\\\ \\end{array} \\] so \\(r = 3^{1/15} - 1 = 0.076.\\) For continuous compounding, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} 3 I_0 &amp;=&amp; I_0 e^{15r} \\\\ 3 &amp;=&amp; e^{15r} \\\\ \\ln (3) &amp;=&amp; 15 r\\\\ \\end{array} \\] so \\(r = \\ln(3)/15= 0.073\\). The rate for annual compounding is larger. That makes sense because the interest ``snowballs’’ faster when you compound continuously. 6.3.5 Exponential decay Radioactive cobalt-60 has a half-life of 5.3 years. If the initial amount is 60 grams, find a formula for the amount of cobalt-60 left after \\(t\\) years. Our function is \\(f(t) = P_0 a^t\\) where \\(t\\) is time in years, and \\(f(t)\\) is the amount of colbalt-60 in grams. Since \\(60 = f(0) = P_0 a^0\\), we know that \\(P_0 = 60\\). Hence, \\(f(t) = 60 a^t\\). Since The half life is 5.3 years, we know that \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} 30 &amp; = &amp; 60 a^{5.3}\\\\ \\frac{30}{60} &amp; = &amp; a^{5.3} \\\\ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^ {1/5.3} &amp; = &amp; a \\\\ 0.877 &amp; \\approx &amp; a. \\end{array} \\] Therefore, \\(f(t) = 60(0.877)^t\\). 6.3.6 Doubling time We want to solve \\(f(t)=20\\) for \\(t\\). \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} 20 &amp; = &amp; 10 e^{1.2t}\\\\ 2 &amp; = &amp; e^{1.2t} \\\\ \\ln(2) &amp;=&amp; 1.2 t \\end{array} \\] so \\(t = \\ln(2)/1.2 = 0.578\\). 6.3.7 People and vehicles Our formulas are \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} v(t) &amp; = &amp; 170(1.04)^t\\\\ p(t) &amp; = &amp; 227(1.01)^t. \\end{array} \\] 1. We want to solve \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} v(t) &amp; = &amp; p(t) \\\\ 170(1.04)^t &amp; = &amp; 227(1.01)^t \\\\ \\left( \\frac{1.04}{1.01} \\right)^t &amp; = &amp; \\frac{227}{170} \\\\ (1.0297) ^ t &amp; = &amp; 227/170 \\\\ t \\ln (1.0297) &amp; = &amp; \\ln (1.3353) \\\\ t &amp; \\approx &amp; 9.87. \\end{array} \\] Since \\(t\\) is years since 1980, there will be one car per person in the year 1980 + 9.87 = 1989.87, that is, nearly 1990. Here is a plot of the two functions. Our models predict \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} v(40) &amp; = &amp; 170(1.04)^{40} \\approx 816.17 \\text{ million vehicles}\\\\ p(40) &amp; = &amp; 227(1.01)^{40} \\approx 337.97 \\text{ million vehicles.} \\end{array} \\] Google says that in 2020, there were about 273.6 million vehicles and 328.2 million people. So our model’s predictions are not accurate.

Therefore \\(k=e^c=0.255\\) and the power function is \\[ F = 0.255 L^{1.32}. \\] Since \\(p&gt;1\\), the fin lengths increase faster than the body length. This makes sense to me, since those fins have to push around all of that mass (which grows faster than the length, too). 7.3.4 Specific heat Here are my desmos calculations. The log-log plot looks linear with a negative slope. So the specific heat is inversely proportional to atomic weight. Fitting \\(\\ln(s) = p \\ln(w) + c\\) gives \\(p=-0.985\\) and \\(c=1.760\\).

Explain the effect of changing the four parameters of sine and cosine functions. Recognize and model periodic phenomena. 8.2 Activities 8.2.1 Periodic function examples Brainstorm at your table! Give four examples of periodic phenomena. Can you think of a periodic phenomenon that doesn’t “look like” a sine function. (We’ve already seen one: the electrocardiagram pattern for a heartbeat), 8.2.2 Find a periodic formula For each graph shown, write down a corresponding periodic formula of the form \\(A \\sin(\\omega x) + C\\) or \\(A \\cos(\\omega x) + C\\). 8.2.3 Variable star Mira is a red giant star in the constellation Cetus. Its brightness (as seen from Earth) fluctuates as it expands and contracts. The apparent magnitude ranges from a maximum of 10th magnitude to a minimum of 2nd magnitude. This apparent brightness has a period of 332 days. Find a formula that models the brightness of Mira as a function of time, with \\(t=0\\) at peak brightness. 8.2.4 Tides and currents Here is a plot of the water level (in red) and the current speed (in blue) of the St. Johns River. Each of them go through two cycles in 24.83 hours. This is the length of one lunar day: the time it takes for a point on the Earth to rotate from an exact point under the Moon to that same point under the Moon. (This is slightly longer than one day because the Moon revolves around the Earth in the same direction as the Earth’s rotation.) So you can assume that the period for each is 12.415 hours. Model the water level \\(w(t)\\) and the current speed \\(c(t)\\) using periodic functions, where \\(t\\) is the number of hours since midnight April 28, 1998. Be sure to use the appropriate vertical axis for each one! Decide which one will be easier to model: \\(w(t)\\) or \\(c(t)\\)? Do that one first, and then adjust that function to get the other one.

The period is 332 days, so our formula is \\[ 4 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{335} t\\right).\\] 8.3.4 Tides and currents The current speed uses the vertical axis on the left. The maximum is 3 and the minimum is -3. So the amplitude is 3 and there is no vertical shift. The maximuum is achieved at \\(t=0\\), so we can just use a cosine curve: \\[ c(t) = 3 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{12.415} t \\right) \\] The water level is modeled by a cosine curve shifted to the right. The water level has amplitude \\((5.5 - (-0.5))/2) = 6/2=3\\) and vertical shift \\((5.5 + (-0.5))/2) = 3\\). The period is \\(12.415\\) hours, and we must shift to the right by one fourth of that amount, so \\(\\phi=-12.415/4 \\approx -3.1\\).

Estimate what you don’t know! Ask a series of smaller questions. Estimate the answers to the smaller questions. Multiply and pay attention to units. Remember, we’re trying to estimate! Do not obsess over details, but also, Do not guess blindly. Find a middle ground! Pro Tip #1: Identify smaller problems that you can estimate using your everyday common sense. For example, rather than estimating the height of of a building, I would estimate the height of one floor and estimate the number of floors, and then multiply. Pro Tip #2: When estimating, determine the order of magnitude (10, 100, 1000, etc). Use the geometric mean when you think the answer is somewhere in between. For example, if you think 1,000 is too small but that 10,000 is too big, then use 3,000. 12.2 Some Useful Data The following approximate data may be useful in various Fermi problems.

How many babies are born each day? It will be helpful to know that (a) there are 7.8 billion people on the planet, (b) the average life expectancy is 73 years, and (c) the population doesn’t change that much (relatively speakiing) in one year. If all 7.8 billion humans in the world were crammed together, how much area would we require? Is this closer to the size of a city, a state, the U.S., or North America? Start by figuring out how many people would fit in 1 square meter. Then figure out how many square kilometers we would need. 12.4 Solutions I think that I can estimate the number of blades in a square inch. 10 is too small, 100 seems okay, but 1000 is too many. Among my choices of 30, 100 and 300, I guess that I like 100 blades per square inch. I know that a football field is 100 yards long. I guess that the end zones are 10 yards deep, for 120 yards total. I’ll estimate that the field is 30 yards across. So my answer would be \\[ \\left(100 \\, \\frac{\\mbox{blades}}{\\mbox{in}^2} \\right) \\left(36^2 \\, \\frac{\\mbox{in}^2}{\\mbox{yard}^2} \\right) \\left(120 \\mbox{ yards} \\right) \\left(30 \\mbox{ yards} \\right) = 4.7 \\times 10^8 \\] and my final estimate is 500 million blades of grass. The population of the earth is growing, but not very quickly. So let’s assume that the number of deaths is the same as the number of births. Life expectancy is 73 years, so about 1/73 of the population dies each year. So 1/73 of the population is also born each year. This leads to the estimation: \\[ 7.8 \\times 10^9 \\mbox{ people} \\times \\frac{1 \\mbox{ birth/year}}{73 \\mbox{ people}} \\times \\frac{1 \\mbox{ year}}{365 \\mbox{ days}} = 292,738 \\frac{\\mbox{ births}}{\\mbox{ day}}. \\] So my final estimation is \\(300,000\\) babies born per day. Let’s start with the hint: How many people could we cram into one square meter? I think that we could fit about 10 people (but not 30). So we would need \\[ \\left( 7.8 \\times 10^9 \\mbox{ people} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 \\mbox{ m}^2}{10 \\mbox{ people}} \\right) = 7.8 \\times 10^8 \\mbox{ m}^2 \\] to fit everyone on the planet. Converting to square kilometers requires dividing by \\((10^3)^2 = 10^6\\), which gives \\[ \\left( 7.8 \\times 10^8 \\mbox{ m}^2 \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 \\mbox{ km}^2}{10^6 \\mbox{ m}^2} \\right) = 780 \\mbox{ km}^2. \\] This is less than \\(30^2=900\\), which is much closer to the size of a city than the size of a state.

You got a negative number for \\(F&#39;(1995)\\). Does that make sense with the situation? Why? Give an example of a year that, if you had the data for it, would better help us estimate \\(F&#39;(1995)\\). Why? 13.4 A Moving Particle A particle’s position over time is given by the formula \\[ s(t)=2+3\\sin(4t)+1.2t^2 \\] Find the velocity at \\(t=1\\) and \\(t=2\\) numerically (using small subintervals). Remember that the velocity is the derivative of the position. Use desmos to graph the position curve \\(s(t)\\) and the tangent lines at both \\(t=1\\) and \\(t=2\\). 13.5 Solutions 13.5.1 Studying Suppose that spending 3 extra hours on studying increases our percent grade on an exam by 14 percent. The derivative is \\(\\frac{14}{3} = 4.67\\) percent per hour. The interpretation: for every hour that you spend studying, your grade increases by \\(4.67\\%\\). This rate of change is not constant. After studying for a while, you reach “burn out”, or perhaps you run out of new material to master. In addition, your grade tops out at 100%, so we cannot increase forever. 13.5.2 Marginal Cost The marginal cost is \\[ \\frac{250,440 - 250,000}{102-100}=\\frac{440}{2} =220 \\mbox{ dollars per phone} \\] I estimate that the cost of making 1030 phones is \\[ 250,000 + 200 \\cdot 30 = 256,600. \\] 13.6 Farmland in the United States When estimating the derivative, we need to “stay local” in order to get the most reliable estimate. There are three equally good choices here: \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} f&#39;(1995) &amp;\\approx&amp; \\frac{f(2000)-f(1995)}{2000-1995}=\\frac{945-963}{5} = - \\frac{18}{5} = -3.6 \\\\ f&#39;(1995) &amp;\\approx&amp; \\frac{f(1995)-f(1990)}{1995-1990}=\\frac{963-987}{5} = - \\frac{24}{5} = -4.8 \\\\ f&#39;(1995) &amp;\\approx&amp; \\frac{f(2000)-f(1990)}{2000-1990}=\\frac{945-987}{10} = - \\frac{42}{10} = -4.2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Any of the three estimates are good answers. Since we are estimating there isn’t a “right answer.” All three stay close to 1995, so each one is good. We got a negative number because the acreage is decreasing. If we had the data for 1994 or 1996, using these valuues would give us a better estimate. Using smaller and smaller intervals will give us a more accurate estimation. (But we cannot tell up front how “small” we need to be to get the accurracy we desire.) 13.7 A Moving Particle Using desmos, we know that \\[ s&#39;(1) \\approx \\frac{s(1+h)-s(1)}{h} \\approx -5.44 \\] when \\(0 &lt; h &lt; 0.00001\\). Similarly, we have \\[ s&#39;(1) \\approx \\frac{s(2+h)-s(2)}{h} \\approx 5.03 \\] when \\(0 &lt; h &lt; 0.00001\\). Here are the commands to plot the curve and the two tangent lines. \\[ \\begin{array}{l} s\\left(t\\right)=2+3\\sin(4t)+1.2t^{2} \\\\ \\\\ y = -5.44(t-1) + s(1) \\\\ \\\\ y = 5.03(t-2) + s(2) \\\\ \\end{array} \\] "],["the-second-derivative.html", "14 The Second Derivative 14.1 Activities 14.2 Function Matching 14.3 A Plot of Velocity 14.4 Characterize the Derivatives", " 14 The Second Derivative 14.1 Activities 14.1.1 Estimating the first and second derivatives from a graph Here is a plot of the function \\(f(x)\\).
