## Activities


### Building Differential Equations

Each scenario  describes a system that changes over time. Write a differential equation that models the change.

1. A population $P$ grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population. 
2. Dead leaves $L$  accumulate on the ground at a rate of 3 grams per square centimeter per year. At the same time, the leaves decompose at a continuous rate of 75\% per year. 
3. The principal $P$ of a home mortgage increases at 5\% a year and the annual payment is \$10000.
4. Bacteria grow proportionally to the product of the current population $N$ and the difference between the carrying capacity $M$ and the current population $N$.


### Solve the Differential Equation

Use your knowledge of anti-derivatives to solve the following differential equations

1. $\displaystyle{ \frac{dy}{dx} = \cos(2 \pi x)}$
2. $\displaystyle{ \frac{ds}{dt} = a t + v}$ where $a$ and $v$ are constants.
3. $\displaystyle{ \frac{dP}{dq} = \frac{100}{q}}$ where $P(1) = 200$.
4. $\displaystyle{ \frac{dy}{dx} = e^{-x}}$ where $P(2) = 0$.


### Verifying Solutions to Differential Equations

Determine which of the following functions are solutions to the differential equation
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} =3y.
$$

1. $y=x^3$
2. $y=e^{3x}$
3. $y=\sin(3x)+\cos(3x)$
4. $y=0$
