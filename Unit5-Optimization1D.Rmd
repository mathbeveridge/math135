### First Derivative Test

Find the critical point(s) of the following functions. Then use the first derivative test to determine whether it is a local minimum, a local maximum, or neither

1. $f(x) = x - e^x$
1. $g(x) = x + \sin(x)$ on $[0,2\pi]$


### Second Derivative Test

The function $f(x) = x^4-8 x^3+22 x^2-24 x$ has critical points at $x=1$ and $x=2$ and $x=3$.

1. Find $f''(x)$.
2. Use the second derivative test to determine whether each of the critical points is a minimum or a maximum.


### Cupcake Store

A cupcake store finds that at a price of \$4.00, the demand is 400 cupcakes. For every \$.25 decrease in price, the demand increases by 20 cupcakes. 

1. Define a function $q(x)$ that gives the demand for cupcakes at a price of $x$ dollars.
2. The revenue for a price of $x$ dollars is $r(x) = x \cdot q(x)$. Use your function from part (a) to find the price that maximizes revenue.

Find the price and quantity that maximize the revenue.
