# Slope Fields

## Creating a Slope Field in RStudio

The `mosaicCalc` package has a `vectorfield_plot` function that we use to create a slope field. So we need to make sure that this package has been loaded into RStudio.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mosaicCalc))
```

Here is the code to create the slope field for $\displaystyle{\frac{dP}{dt} = 5 - 2 P}$


```{r}
vectorfield_plot(t ~ 1,
P ~ 6 - 2 * P,
bounds(t=-8:8, P=-8:8))
```

## Activities


### Match the Slope Field


Match each of the following differential equations with its slope field. *Hint:* start by setting $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ and solving for $y$. The slopes along the resulting curve will always be horizontal.


1. $\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx}=xy}$
1. $\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x}{y}}$
1. $\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx}=x+y}$
1. $\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx}=x-y}$

## Draw Some Trajectories

For each of the above slope fields, sketch the solution curves that satisfy

1. $y(0) = 1$
1. $y(0) = 0$
1. $y(0) = -1$


## Slope Fields for Population Models

Create a slope field for each of the following population models. For each one, describe the long-term behavior for a variety of intial populations. For which initial values of $P$ does the population increase without bound? stabilize to a constant value? die out? 

1. Exponential growth with harvesting
$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.2 P - 80
$$
for  $0 \leq P \leq 400$ and $0 \leq t \leq 100$.

<!--
```{r}
vectorfield_plot(t ~ 1,
P ~  0.2 * P -  40,
bounds(t=0:100, P=0:400))
```
-->

2. Constrained growth
$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.05 P  (1 - 0.01 P) 
$$
for  $0 \leq P \leq 600$ and $0 \leq t \leq 50$.

<!--
```{r}
vectorfield_plot(t ~ 1,
P ~  0.05  * P *  (1 - 0.002 * P),
bounds(t=0:50, P=0:600))
```
-->


3. Constrained growth with constant harvesting
$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.05 P  (1 - 0.002 P) - 4
$$
for  $0 \leq P \leq 600$ and $0 \leq t \leq 50$.

<!--
```{r}
vectorfield_plot(t ~ 1,
P ~  0.05  * P *  (1 - 0.002 * P) - 4,
bounds(t=0:50, P=0:600))
```
