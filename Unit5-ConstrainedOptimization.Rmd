# Constrained 2D Optimization

## Creating a Contour Plot for 2D Optimization

Here is some example code to create a plot of an objective function $P(x,y) =  x^(0.2) * y^(0.8)$ and a constraint function $Q(x,y)=4*x + 3*y=200$.

```{r eval=FALSE}

P = makeFun( x^(0.2) * y^(0.8) ~ x&y)
Q = makeFun( 4*x + 3*y ~ x&y)

plotFun(P(x,y)~x&y, xlim=c(0,40), ylim=c(20,60), filled=FALSE, levels=seq(20,50,4))

plotFun(Q(x,y)~x&y, add=TRUE, filled=FALSE, levels=200)

```


## Activities

### Constrained Production

A company produces $P(x,y) = 100 x^{4/11} y^{7/11}$ units of its product from raw materials $x$ and $y$. The cost of each unit of $x$ is \$5 and the cost of each unit of $y$ is \$4.

1. Find the maximal output for a budget of \$500, along with how much input $x$ and $y$ is used to create them. (Hint: plot your contour diagram on the domain $0 \leq x \leq 100$ and $0 \leq y \leq 100$.)

2. What is the maximal output if the unit cost of $x$ increases to \$7? How much of inputs $x$ and $y$ are used?

3. What is the maximal outpuut if the unit cost of $x$ returns to \$5 and the budget is decreased to \$300? How much of inputs $x$ and $y$ are used?

### Constrained Optimization on a Circle

Below is a plot of an objective function $f(x,y)$ in red, and its constraint function $g(x,y)=9$ in blue. 

1. Estimate  the **minimum** value of $f(x,y)$ constrained to $g(x,y)=9$. What point achieves this minimum?
1. Estimate  the **maximum** value of $f(x,y)$ constrained to $g(x,y)=9$. What point achieves this maximum?

### Estimating the Lagrange Multiplier

Below is a plot of an objective function $f(x,y)$ in red, and its constraint function $g(x,y)$ for various budgets in blue (in thousands of dollars).

1. Estimate the point $(x,y)$ that  maximizes production for a budget of $g(x,y)=15$. What is the production level?
2. Estimate the point $(x,y)$ that maximizes production for a budget of $g(x,y)=20$. What is the production level?
3. What is the value of the Lagrange multiplier for the budget $g(x,y)=15$? What are the units? What does this number mean?
4. What price would make this increase useful to the company? (Hint: the units for your answer are "dollars per unit produced.")
